This Hack Compiler has been designed as part of the Nand2Tetris course, in which a full-blown computer is built from the groud up. This compiler is designed to translate source code written in the Hack programming language into Hack assembly code, which can then be executed on the Hack hardware platform.

The Hack Compiler is built using a combination of high-level and low-level programming concepts. It is divided into several modules, each of which is responsible for a specific stage of the compilation process. These modules include a tokenizer and a parser.

The tokenizer, for example, is responsible for breaking the source code into individual tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, and symbols. The parser then uses these tokens to construct an abstract syntax tree (AST), which represents the structure of the code in a more formal and organized way. The Hack Compiler supports many of the common programming constructs found in modern programming languages, including variables, control structures, functions, and arrays.
